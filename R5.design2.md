## R05: Software Design 2: Add More Details to your Design

You have two tasks to complete before next time:
- Complete agile report
- Enhance the file design.md with more details of your design.
- This builds off of [R04 Design](r04-design.md)

Today's work will continue the move from the planning and analysis phase to the design phase by fleshing out many more of the details of your software project.

It is expected that the software architectural design will be:

- a simplified description of the entire planned project system which abstracts the essentials and ignores the non-essentials;
- defines the major software components (classes, methods, etc);
- uses a hierarchical presentation which makes the system simple to understand;
- shows the flow of control and data through the system;
- is organized according to consistent conventions;
- can be used for reasoning about the software system.

Any architectural software design which satisfies the above criteria may be used. Many
software developers use schematic designs of the planned software components as part of
their modeling description, but this is not required. It is acceptable to list the planned
software components with brief descriptions as long as the control hierarchy and
interactions among the components are also made clear.

You should have added the relative link to design.md from README.md and tested it to make sure it works.
