# CSC 493: R01: Project Concept Proposal<sup>1</sup>

As you know, the **Project Concept Proposal** is typically used to make a case for a project and it is frequently the first document to be created in the software development life cycle. You have begun your <code>README.md</code> for the initial part of your project concept proposal by drafting the following sections:

<code>README.md</code>
- Project name
- **Project Concept (linked to <code>concept.md</code>)**
- Prerequisites
- Built With
- Author name
- Acknowledgments

## Concept Proposal
We want you to take some of the feedback you received from the brainstorming session to flesh out your project and give a more formal proposal. We understand that at this point, some of what you write will be guesses, so this is a <strong>living document</strong> that may change over time. Create a file called <code>concept.md</code> in your repository and include details in the following sections:

<code>concept.md</code>
  - Project Name
  - Goals
  - Context
  - Novelty
  - Functionality
  - Audience
  - Challenges
  - Measures
  - Motivation
  - Future Extensions
  - *Other (Optional)*

**Goals:** This product aims to preserve the recording of a device's camera by preventing others aside from the user from stopping a recording or deleting captured videos from the device. The idea is to benefit those using video recording to try to protect themselves from false testimony, corruption, abuse, or any other situation where recording can be a deterrant or agent of accountability.

**Context:** This would be useful in situations where authorities may try to prevent a victim/target from recording unlawful conduct on behalf of the authorities or where a person may try to prevent another from recording them so they can assault them, steal their stuff, or do any other violating act. Other products have slightly similar functionality, but focus more on [being multifaceted apps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.aclu.mobile.justice.ca) or [disbursing the recording to others](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Aadi.pulledover). 

**Novelty:** The novelty is the ability to lock a recording so that it can only be stopped with an authentication from the user or possibly turning the phone off.

**Functionality:** 
- Record with the ability to lock the recording
- Self contained video library
- Authentication for modifying video files
- Auto backup to cloud during recording
- Continue recording with screen locked

**Audience:** This is intended for those who have any reason to use video recording as a protection in a situation where the other party may try to take this protection away. 
- Activists
- Victims of abuse
- Victims of police misconduct
- Constitutional auditors
- Victims of general crime

**Challenges:** 
- Learning a new language
- Dealing with new frameworks
- Working with the cloud
- Figuring out the proper scope
- Testing the app
- Controlling hardware
- Laying out the timeline

**Measures:** An outline of project measures of success (how you will know when you have met the requirements.)
- Functional video recording locked behind authentication
- Authentication integrated with device unlock method
- Recordings stored in scoped storage locked behind authentication
- Ability to backup to the cloud in some form

**Motivation:** I have become very interested in the constitutional auditing community and police misconduct over the past few years. This project is a way for me to get involved in a cause that I care about and wish to contribute towards. This also adds to my portfolio and my skills as a developer.

**Future Extensions:** 
- Video transcripts generated
- Uploading to social media or sharing

**Other:** (Optional section) To the above, you may add any additional items that you think will strengthen your proposal.

You may want to use [MarkDown cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet) and [MarkDown Live Demo](http://www.markdown-here.com/livedemo.html).

Add a relative link to concept.md from README.md to concept.md. (A relative link uses just the file name and not http://...) Test this link and make sure it works.

# To Submit 

See [Awesome READMEs](https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme) for a list of great README files. In addition to creating the <code>concept.md</code> file, update <code>README.md</code> with any imnprovements and a link to the <code>concept.md</code> file.
