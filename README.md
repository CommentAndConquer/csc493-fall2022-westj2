# *CamLock*
## App designed to preserve a recording session during interactions as well as the resulting video

Your formally written project proposal description, and why it is useful/interesting/fun goes here. Try to be as descriptive as possible, as we will be discussing your project ideas during the brainstorming in class.

### Scope 

 Camlock is a recording application, so a stable recording session with minimal crashes. Anything outside of a basic camera preview and maybe basic low light capabilities or other context useful camera settings are out of scope. A video gallery will be necessary with the ability to view, delete, or export videos. Any other editing functionality would be out of scope. The recording itself will have some sort of verbose logging or other watermarking, any other modifications are out of scope. Livestreaming is a feature I anticipate stakeholders may want.

### Vision

My project gives people a more secure way to hold others accountable. At the conclusion of my project, I anticipate a more transparent world and increased safety. Users will be able to protect themselves in dangerous or unlawful encounters and the perpetrators will have a more difficult time covering up their actions or discrediting evidence of their actions.
